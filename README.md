# Python Jupyter Notebooks for Linear Algebra

This repository contains the linear algbra chapter that I wrote for the upcoming book "Python Jupyter Notebooks for College Math Teachers." 

The linear algebra chapter serves as introductory exploration of fundamental concepts in linear algebra with a focus on computational aspects with Python. It also serves as foundational background for the subsequent chapter, ‚ÄúLinear Algebra and Optimization for Data Analysis‚Äù.

Each section is a Jupyter notebook and begins with a brief overview of the objectives and followed by several examples exercises to enhance understanding and facilitate learning. Moreover, I aim to include numerical notes wherever appropriate. These notes aim to explain and compare different computational approaches to problem-solving. My goal is to write my own code (whenever possible) to solve problems. However, for matrices of higher dimensions, we take advantage of the NumPy linear algebra module which provide efficient implementations of standard linear algebra algorithms.


üöÄ **What's Inside:**
- Ready-to-use Jupyter notebooks for linear algebra
- Visualizations and interactive examples
- Hands-on exercises and solutions
- Practical applications for the classroom


üì¶ **Getting Started:**
These notebooks are designed for motivated students and teachers! Feel free to clone this repository and explore the notebooks.

üìù **Contribute:**
If you have any suggestions, improvements, or want to contribute your own notebooks to enrich this resource, we welcome your input. Together, we can create an even more valuable tool for math educators.

Stay tuned for the book's release, and let's empower math teachers and students with the power of Python and Jupyter!
